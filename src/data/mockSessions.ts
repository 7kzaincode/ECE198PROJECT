/**
 * MOCK DATA DISABLED - Using Real Firestore Data
 * 
 * This file is kept for reference only. The dashboard now uses real-time
 * Firestore data via subscribeToCognitiveSessions() in src/lib/firebase.ts
 * 
 * All mock data functions have been removed. The app will show:
 * - Loading state while fetching from Firestore
 * - "No data yet" message if no sessions exist
 * - Real-time updates when new data arrives from Arduino/Python script
 */

// This file is intentionally empty - all data now comes from Firestore
